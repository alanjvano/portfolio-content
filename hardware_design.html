            <p>The frame of the hexacopter must be durable, yet light as possible.  Any unnecessary weight will put a greater strain on the motors resulting in a less thrust and shorter flight time.  Although carbon-fiber frames would be most ideal for this they are exepensive are must be custom made.  For this project, a simple piece of plywood was used as the center structure for the hexacopter.  Each of the six arms were constructed from aluminium L-shaped bars.  Alumninum was chosen as it is lightweight and the L-shape provided durability across two directions.  Lego pieces where then used to contruct a battery compartment and served as mountings for all the electronics.  Legos were used for this task as they are cheap, light, easily configurable and did not have an load-bearing purposes.</p>
